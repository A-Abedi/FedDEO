# FedDEO
The pytorch implementation of FedDEO: Description-Enhanced One-Shot Federated Learning with Diffusion Models

FedDEO is a Description-Enhanced One-Shot Federated Learning Method with Diffusion Models, offering a novel exploration of utilizing the DM in OSFL. The core idea of FedDEO involves training local descriptions on the clients, serving as the medium to transfer the knowledge of the distributed clients to the server.
